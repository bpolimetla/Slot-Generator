# Slot Generator for Apartment — COVID-Safe Grocery Scheduling

## Problem Statement
During COVID-19, a 720-apartment community required a fair, low-contact system for accessing the on-site grocery shop. The **Slot Generator** provides each flat with a **30-minute** entry window between **07:00 and 17:00**. Residents are allowed to queue **only within their assigned slot**.

## Assumptions & Rules
- Expect **≤ 50%** of residents to shop on any given day. If turnout exceeds this, customers are admitted on a **first-come, first-served** basis within their slot.  
- Parameters such as shop hours, slot length, and turnout assumptions should be **easily configurable**.  
- Output should generate a **CSV-ready schedule** (with placeholders like `day1`, `day2` that can be replaced with actual dates).  

## Notes
- The initial version is a simple, **non-optimized** Java implementation.  
- Code can be run in an online editor (e.g., **OnlineGDB**) by copy-paste execution.

# Project Guide

## How to Run the Code
This project requires no local IDE setup.  

1. Copy the Java source code.  
2. Open **OnlineGDB**: <https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler>  
3. Paste the code, press **Run**, and view the console output.  

## Result
- Copy the console output into a **.csv** file.  
- Open it in **Excel** or another spreadsheet tool for formatting.  
- Replace `day1`, `day2`, … with actual **calendar dates**.  

## TODO
- Parameterize shop hours, slot duration, and capacity assumptions.  
- Improve coding standards and documentation.  
- Add input validation and error handling.  
- Provide unit tests and example CSV outputs.
